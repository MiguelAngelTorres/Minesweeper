########################################   MINESWEEPER    ###########################################.
  Classic minesweeper made in C++ with custom rows and columns for terminal.

  If you want to play you just need to download the files and use make to build the execution file. 
Once open, you will have to specify how much arros, columns and mines do you want for your game.

  The game will produce a game table each time you execute and action. The actions are open (o <r> <c>) and mark (m <r> <c>) where
r and c are the place where you want to execute the action. You will win if you open all the table game charts that are not 
containing a boomb. Open a place where is situated a bomb means the defeat.


  Have fun and look for improvements in my code.
